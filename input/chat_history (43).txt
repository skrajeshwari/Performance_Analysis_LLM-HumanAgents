These models are designed to fit onto edge and mobile devices and come in both pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions. The 1B and 3B models support a context length of 128K tokens. Additionally, Llama 3.2 is optimized for image reasoning use cases, such as understanding documents that include charts and graphs, and captioning images. The Llama Guard 3 1B model has been pruned and quantized to reduce its size significantly, making it more efficient for deployment. Llama 3.2 models are available for download on llama.com and Hugging Face.
