You are a performance analyst tasked with evaluating the responses of a language model (LLM) against human agent responses.
Below is a dataset containing chat interactions between customers, an LLM system, and a human agent. Analyze the data based on the specified criteria and provide a deterministic, structured report for performance evaluation. Follow the structure outlined below.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains the following columns:

- New Session : <Agent Name> <timestamp>
- Lap No: The conversation sequence number.
- Timestamp: The time of each interaction.
- Customer Query: The question or message from the customer.
- Sentiment: The sentiment of the customer (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).
- Category: The general type of the query.
- Intent: The specific intent of the customer's query.
- RAG Status: Whether the system used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- System Response: The LLM's reply to the customer.
- Human Response: The human agent's reply to the customer.

Analysis Criteria:
Perform the following analysis on the dataset (please do not put any puntuation marks except comma (,), full stop (.) or semi column (:) in the output)

1. Accuracy and Relevance (Score: 30%):
    - Compare the LLM response with the human response for correctness, relevance, and clarity.
    - Evaluate whether the LLM captured the context and provided accurate information.
    - Scoring:
        - Full points (30%) for accurate and contextually relevant responses.
        - Partial points (15%) for partially correct or unclear responses.
        - No points (0%) for incorrect or irrelevant responses.

2. **Politeness and Tone (Score: 20%)**:
    - Compare the tone and politeness of the LLM's response with the human agent's.
    - Evaluate whether the LLM maintained professionalism and empathy in its responses.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (20%) for consistently polite and empathetic responses.
        - Deduct points (-5% per instance) for responses lacking empathy or professionalism.

3. **Context Awareness (Score: 15%)**:
    - Analyze whether the LLM maintained continuity and understood the conversation context across multiple turns.
    - Compare the LLM's context awareness to the human agent's.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (15%) for maintaining continuity and appropriately referencing prior interactions.
        - Partial points (7.5%) for minor lapses in context.
        - No points (0%) for completely losing context.

4. **Resolution Capability (Score: 20%)**:
    - Evaluate whether the LLM successfully resolved the customer's query.
    - Compare its resolution rate with that of the human agent.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (20%) for resolving queries effectively.
        - Partial points (10%) for partial resolutions.
        - No points (0%) for unresolved queries.

5. **Sentiment Alignment (Score: 10%)**:
    - Assess whether the LLM aligned its tone and content with the sentiment expressed by the customer.
    - Compare the LLM's sentiment handling with the human agent's approach.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (10%) for effectively addressing sentiment shifts.
        - Partial points (5%) for neutral handling of sentiment.
        - No points (0%) for worsening sentiment or ignoring customer emotions.

6. **Efficiency and Turn Optimization (Score: 5%)**:
    - Analyze the number of turns required to resolve queries for the LLM compared to the human agent.
    - Evaluate whether the LLM provided concise responses to minimize back-and-forth interactions.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (5%) for concise and efficient interactions.
        - Deduct points (-1% per unnecessary turn).

Analysis Criteria:
Perform the following analysis on the dataset (please do not put any puntuation marks except comma (,), full stop (.) or semi column (:) in the output)

1. **Query Resolution** (Score: 30%):
    - Was the customer query resolved based on the System Response and Human Response?
    - Highlight unresolved queries and provide feedback.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (30%) for resolved queries.
        - Partial points (15%) for partially resolved queries.
        - No points (0%) for unresolved queries.

2. **Politeness** (Score: 20%):
    - Analyze the Human Response to determine whether the agent responded politely.
    - Provide feedback for laps where the response lacked politeness.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (20%) for consistent politeness.
        - Deduct points (-5% per instance) for impolite responses.

3. **System vs. Human Accuracy** (Score: 20%):
    - Compare how often the system provided the correct response versus when the human agent had to correct it.
    - Identify patterns where the system frequently needed correction or where the human agent intervened.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (20%) for accurate system responses and necessary corrections by the human agent.
        - Deduct points for system errors (-5% per error corrected by the agent).

4. **RAG Utilization** (Score: 10%):
    - Analyze how often RAG was invoked and whether it correlated with higher accuracy or better resolution.
    - Determine if invoking RAG reduced human intervention.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (10%) for frequent and effective RAG usage.
        - Partial points (5%) for infrequent or ineffective usage.

5. **Sentiment Shift** (Score: 10%):
    - Track the sentiment of the customer throughout the conversation.
    - Report whether sentiment improved, stayed neutral, or became negative.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (10%) for improving customer sentiment.
        - Partial points (5%) for neutral sentiment.
        - No points (0%) for worsening sentiment.

6. **Resolution Efficiency** (Score: 5%):
    - Measure how quickly queries were resolved (number of turns).
    - Report whether higher system accuracy or RAG utilization led to faster resolutions.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (5%) for faster resolutions in fewer turns.
        - Deduct points (-1% per extra turn).

7. **Response Time** (Score: 5%):
    - Analyze the response time of the human agent.
    - Determine if longer response times correlated with unresolved queries or negative sentiment.
    - **Scoring**:
        - Full points (5%) for fast responses.
        - Deduct points for delays (-1% per delayed response).
